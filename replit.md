   - Immediate publishing creates jobs in queue
   - Scheduled posts are stored and processed by scheduler
   - Jobs are processed with platform-specific adaptations
   - Status updates are tracked per platform

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR
- Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- Environment variables for API keys and database connection
- Concurrent development setup with shared types

### Production
- Frontend: Vite build to static assets
- Backend: esbuild compilation to single bundle
- Database: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- Session storage: PostgreSQL with connect-pg-simple
- Environment-based configuration

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema changes
- Push command for development schema updates
- Shared schema types between frontend and backend

### Security Considerations
- Session secret configuration
- OAuth client secret management
- Database connection string security
- CORS and security middleware setup

The application follows a clean separation of concerns with shared TypeScript types, making it maintainable and scalable for adding new platforms or features.
