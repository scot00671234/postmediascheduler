- [x] build-production.js for custom build process
- [x] Proper static asset organization

### Environment Variables
- [x] DATABASE_URL automatic connection to Railway PostgreSQL
- [x] SESSION_SECRET for secure sessions
- [x] NODE_ENV=production detection
- [x] Optional SMTP, Stripe, OAuth configuration

### Health Monitoring
- [x] /health endpoint for monitoring

### Deployment Files
- [x] RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Complete setup instructions
- [x] .env.railway - Environment variables template
- [x] railway.json - Railway deployment configuration
- [x] nixpacks.toml - Build configuration

## Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Railway
3. Add PostgreSQL service
4. Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, NODE_ENV)
5. Deploy automatically
6. All tables created on first startup
7. Application ready for production use

## Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Visit /health endpoint
- [ ] Check Railway PostgreSQL dashboard for tables
- [ ] Test user registration/login
- [ ] Verify file uploads work
- [ ] Confirm session persistence

**Status: 100% PRODUCTION READY FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT**
