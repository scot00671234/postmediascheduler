## ðŸ”§ Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables to Set
```
DATABASE_URL=<automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL>
SESSION_SECRET=<generate secure random string>
NODE_ENV=production

# Stripe (required for subscriptions)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...

# SMTP Email (required for email features)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourdomain.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASS=<your-smtp-password>
